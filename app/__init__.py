Module: Initialization File
Description:
    This file marks the directory as a Python package. It can be used for
    package-level initialization code, such as defining package-wide constants,
    importing submodules to simplify access, or setting up logging for the package.

    Although it can be empty, it is required for the directory to be recognized
    as a package, which allows for relative imports and proper module resolution
    within the package structure.
